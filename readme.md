## Vox-MSD in nnssl Framework
Inspired by our recently published work - .[Vox-MMSD][https://github.com/HiLab-git/Vox-MMSD], we design a self-supervised framework Vox-MSD for OpenMind pre-training. This is the nnssl version of Vox-MSD.

This code is used for SSL3D challenge. The command in run.sh is used for runing Vox-MSD under ResEncL and PrimusM.
